Finapp is a personal budget tracking (mobile friendly) web application, while it's very basic I didn't find a free solution to collaborate list of expenses with my family.

Every list has a "family uid" and only users with the same "family uid" can read and update that list.

# Features

1. Recording expenses of each month.
2. Adding collaborators.
